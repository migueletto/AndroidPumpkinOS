AndroidPumpkinOS is a port of PumpkinOS to the Android platform.

This is a work in progress and not ready for deployment. That is why it is not available on Google Play, and there is no pre build APK for download. Everything must be compiled from source.
I have been using an old version of Android Studio (2020.3), because I gave up on downloading a few gigabytes every now and then just to keep the SDK updated.
Bottom line is, I have no idea if it compiles on a recent release.
I have used mostly the simulator for trying PumpkinOS, running on real devices is not tested.
After things get a little more stable, I will try to update the build environment.
